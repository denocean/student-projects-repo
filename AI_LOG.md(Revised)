# Ethics & Accessibility Reflection

 1. What are the main ethical risks of this project?
- **Bias in Models**: ML forecasts may reflect existing biases in housing data (e.g., regional underrepresentation, discriminatory lending history).
- **Misinformation**: LLM-generated summaries could hallucinate or oversimplify, leading to poor decision-making.
- **Overreliance on AI**: Stakeholders may trust AI outputs without verifying the data or considering limitations.

 2. How will you mitigate these risks?
- **Bias Checks**: Regularly audit training datasets for bias and test models across diverse regions.
- **Transparency**: Include disclaimers clarifying that forecasts are probabilistic, not guarantees.
- **Human Oversight**: Encourage policymakers and investors to use outputs alongside expert judgment, not as a substitute.
