## 2. Overview

 In recent years, the rise of mass shootings and violent incidents, particularly in schools and public spaces, has highlighted a significant weakness in our current safety and security frameworks: the lack of proactive threat detection. Traditional emergency systems are reactive, intervening only after violence has already occurred. This time gap often results in devastating consequences. A forward-looking approach must focus not only on response but also on prevention.
This document proposes a Mobile Threat Detection and Police Alert System that leverages the ubiquity of smartphones, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and secure communication networks to identify credible threats of violence in real time and deliver alerts directly to law enforcement authorities. The envisioned system analyzes digital activity—such as text messages, social media interactions, or multimedia content—for early indicators of violent intent. Once detected, the system securely transmits critical threat details, including user identity and geolocation, to the relevant authorities

## 3. Context & Background

- Business Context Violence prevention is a critical national security priority. TDRS aligns with initiatives focused on public safety, school protection, and smart policing. The system supports strategic objectives like reducing response time, enhancing safety infrastructure, and enabling communities to adopt preventative measures. As governments and institutions invest in safer environments, technologies like Threat Dectective and Reporting System (TDRS) strengthen their ability to meet safety OKRs.
- Market/Customer Insights: Primary customers include schools, universities, workplaces, and government agencies seeking enhanced safety measures. Students and staff increasingly demand protection in environments vulnerable to shootings and violent incidents. Surveys show parents and administrators favor technologies that support preventative safety without compromising ethical standards. Law enforcement also requires tools to supplement limited manpower, as officers cannot monitor every potential threat in real time. By leveraging device data and AI, TDRS serves these needs.
- Competitive/Benchmark References: Competing systems focus primarily on post-incident response, such as gunshot detection devices or emergency alert systems. These solutions are valuable but inherently reactive. Benchmarking shows a lack of comprehensive pre-incident technologies that integrate device-based monitoring with law enforcement pipelines.

## 5. User Stories & Use Cases

- Primary User Persona(s): Who benefits?
- User Stories:Law enforcement officers requiring actionable alerts.
- School administrators seeking proactive safety solutions.
- Students and staff benefiting from safer environments.
- As a police officer, I want real-time alerts about high-risk threats so I can act quickly to prevent violence.
- As a school administrator, I can receive reports on potential risks, so that I can safeguard students proactively. As a parent, I want assurance that my child’s school has - preventative measures, so that I feel secure.
- A student’s device activity suggests intent of violence; TDRS identifies and alerts police, who intervene.
Edge Case 1 # 
## False positive threat detected, requiring review before escalation.
Edge Case 2 #
## Network downtime delays transmission; TDRS retries automatically.
